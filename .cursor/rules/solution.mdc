# Solution Documentation Rule

When a problem is successfully resolved during project development, the user will mention this file using `@solution.mdc`. When mentioned, you must:

1. **Document the solution** in `docs/05-troubleshooting.md` under an appropriate section or create a new section if needed.

2. **Include the following information** in the documentation:
   - **What**: Clear description of the problem
   - **Why**: Root cause analysis - why did this problem occur?
   - **When**: When did the problem occur? (date, time, or context)
   - **Where**: Where did the problem occur? (specific file, service, component, environment)
   - **How**: Step-by-step solution with commands, code changes, or procedures
   - **Prevention**: How to prevent this issue in the future (if applicable)

3. **Format the entry** as follows:
   ```markdown
   ### [Problem Title]
   
   **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Context**: Brief context of when/where this occurred
   
   **Problem**: 
   - Description of the issue
   - Error messages or symptoms
   
   **Root Cause**:
   - Why this problem occurred
   - Technical explanation
   
   **Solution**:
   ```bash
   # Commands or steps taken
   ```
   
   **Files Changed**:
   - `path/to/file1` - Description of changes
   - `path/to/file2` - Description of changes
   
   **Prevention**:
   - How to avoid this issue in the future
   - Best practices or checks to implement
   ```

4. **Add the entry** to the most appropriate section in `05-troubleshooting.md`, or create a new section if the problem doesn't fit existing categories.

5. **Maintain chronological order** - add new entries at the end of the relevant section, or at the end of the document if it's a new category.

6. **Be specific and actionable** - future readers should be able to understand and apply the solution.
